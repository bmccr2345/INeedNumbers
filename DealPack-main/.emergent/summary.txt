<analysis>
The trajectory details a comprehensive evolution of a financial tracking and AI coaching application for real estate agents. Initially, the focus was on core features like P&L tracking, recurring expenses, inline editing, a commission cap tracker, and a dashboard-integrated AI Coach. Subsequent iterations enhanced the UI/UX, incorporating AI Coach promotional content on the homepage, styling the dashboard AI Coach with a Fairy AI Coach theme, and integrating reflection/activity logging modals. A significant portion of the recent work involved adding the Fairy AI Coach functionality, including plan gating and state-aware analysis, to the Net Sheet and Affordability calculators. The most recent major pivot involved a comprehensive backend security hardening initiative, including server consolidation, centralized configuration, Redis integration for caching/rate limiting, and Stripe webhook completion. Currently, the agent is implementing the production readiness phase, specifically debugging environment variable validation and  integration with the new .

<product_requirements>
The application, I Need Numbers, aims to provide real estate agents with financial tracking and AI coaching.
1.  **Agent P&L Tracker**: Redesigned to manage income, expenses, monthly summaries, and exports.
2.  **Recurring Expenses**: Expense form allows monthly auto-creation until year-end.
3.  **Inline Editing**: Deals and expenses tables support direct editing.
4.  **Commission Cap Tracker**: New tab for configuring caps and visualizing progress on the dashboard.
5.  **AI Coach**: Provides personalized insights via a dashboard banner, later rebranded to Fairy AI Coach. This includes conversational text analysis, action plans, and risk assessment, leveraging user data. It was later integrated into Net Sheet and Affordability calculators, considering deal state and loan type, with Pro plan gating.
6.  **Action Tracker Enhancements**: Numeric input fixes, Goals moved to a new Goal Settings tab, historical logging for activities and reflections with inline editing.
7.  **Homepage Marketing & Text Updates**: Promotional content for the AI Coach was added and refined. Core homepage hero text was updated multiple times for clarity and impact, and its layout was improved.
8.  **Dashboard UI/UX**: Log Activity/Reflection buttons open pop-up modals. AI Coach section card styling removed, and the AI Coach banner styling was updated to match the Fairy AI Coach purple gradient theme. All Brain icons were swapped to the fairy style.
9.  **Backend Security Hardening**: Comprehensive security measures including CORS, CSRF, rate limits, webhook verification, upload validation, security headers, safer PDF rendering, and OpenAI isolation were implemented.
10. **Production Readiness**: Remove insecure defaults, server consolidation, centralized config with validation, Redis caching/rate limiting, complete Stripe webhooks, PDF branding, structured logging, comprehensive tests, and updated documentation.

<current_work>
The current work is focused on the Production Readiness Plan, specifically integrating the centralized  with  and resolving environment variable validation issues. The AI engineer has:
1.  Removed old backup server files.
2.  Updated  with all required environment variables.
3.  Created  for centralized, Pydantic-based configuration validation.
4.  Updated  to use .
5.  Fixed security import fallbacks in .
6.  Added  and updated  for Redis-based rate limiting.
7.  Completed Stripe webhook TODOs in .
8.  Updated  with new dependencies and fixed  version conflicts.

The agent is currently debugging 's startup, which is failing due to missing critical environment variables like , , , and S3 credentials. The latest attempt involved making S3 credentials optional in development and adding  as an optional field in  to allow the application to start without all production-specific keys during development. The application is still not starting successfully due to configuration errors, indicating further refinement is needed in  and  handling.

<optional_next_step>
Add  as an optional field in  to resolve startup failures related to environment variables.
