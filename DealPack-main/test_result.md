# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:

All PDF branding assets now properly handled. ✅ AI COACH BACKEND INTEGRATION (2B): Replaced mock analysis in NetSheetAICoach and AffordabilityAICoach with actual API calls to /api/ai-coach-v2/generate using server-side OpenAI. Updated components to call backend AI Coach with deal_data/affordability_data context, handle 401/503 errors properly, extract analysis from structured JSON response (summary field). AI_COACH_ENABLED=false by default as requested. ✅ PRODUCTION SECURITY: All PDF operations use local-only fetching to prevent SSRF attacks, S3 image processing includes size limits and optimization, error handling with transparent fallbacks for all image operations. Ready for Phase 3."

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "❌ CRITICAL NUMERIC INPUT ISSUE CONFIRMED: Comprehensive testing of Action Tracker Goals settings reveals that the numeric input fields are only accepting single digits instead of multi-digit numbers. ✅ NAVIGATION SUCCESS: Successfully logged in with demo@demo.com, navigated to Action Tracker tab, and accessed Goals sub-tab. ✅ FIELD DETECTION: All 5 target numeric input fields found correctly (Annual GCI Goal, Monthly GCI Target, Average GCI per Closing, Working Days This Month, Earned GCI To Date). ❌ INPUT LIMITATION: When typing '350000' in Annual GCI Goal field, only '3' was entered. When typing '75000' in Earned GCI To Date field, only '7' was entered. This confirms the exact issue reported in the review request. ❌ ADDITIONAL ISSUES: DOM attachment errors during testing suggest potential React state management issues. Backend validation errors (422 status) when saving settings. ❌ ROOT CAUSE: The handleNumericInput function in ActionTrackerPanel.js appears to be limiting input to single characters instead of allowing full multi-digit numbers. The regex pattern /^\d*$/ should allow multiple digits, but the implementation may have a bug in how it processes the input value. URGENT FIX NEEDED: Users cannot enter realistic goal amounts like $350,000 or $25,000 - they can only enter single digits like $3 or $7, making the Goals settings completely unusable for real-world scenarios."

        comment: "🚫 TESTING BLOCKED BY PRO FEATURE RESTRICTION: Comprehensive testing attempted but unable to fully verify the numeric input fix due to system limitations. ❌ CRITICAL BLOCKING ISSUES: 1) Action Tracker shows 'This feature is Pro' modal overlay preventing access to Settings/Goals tab, 2) Demo user (demo@demo.com) appears to be on Free plan, not Pro, blocking Action Tracker functionality, 3) 401 Unauthorized errors when loading tracker data (/api/tracker/settings?month=2025-10), 4) Modal overlay prevents interaction with Action Tracker interface. ✅ LIMITED SUCCESS: Successfully tested decimal input (2.5) in Log tab which worked correctly, indicating some numeric input improvements. 📋 CODE ANALYSIS: Reviewed ActionTrackerPanel.js implementation - main agent has rebuilt the numeric input handling with new handleInputChange function using /^\d+$/.test(value) validation and proper string-to-number conversion. The code structure appears correct for handling multi-digit numbers. ⚠️ TESTING LIMITATION: Cannot verify the specific numeric input fields mentioned in review request (Annual GCI Goal: 350000, Monthly GCI Target: 25000, etc.) due to Pro feature restriction. 🔧 RECOMMENDATION: Main agent needs to either: 1) Upgrade demo user to Pro plan for testing, 2) Temporarily disable Pro restriction for testing, or 3) Provide alternative testing approach. The rebuilt implementation looks promising but requires Pro access for full verification."

Comprehensive testing reveals that despite the user's claim of upgrading demo@demo.com to PRO plan, the user is still on FREE plan and cannot access Action Tracker functionality. ❌ TESTING RESULTS: 1) Successfully logged in with demo@demo.com credentials, 2) Action Tracker shows 'Unlock More Power with Pro' promotional page instead of actual interface, 3) All Action Tracker features are behind Pro paywall, 4) Cannot access Goals tab, Settings tab, or Log tab due to plan restrictions, 5) Found 0/5 target numeric input fields (Annual GCI Goal, Monthly GCI Target, Average GCI per Closing, Working Days This Month, Earned GCI To Date) because they are inaccessible. ❌ PLAN STATUS VERIFICATION: User interface clearly shows Free plan status with Pro upgrade prompts throughout the dashboard. The sidebar shows 'Agent P&L Tracker Pro' and 'Cap Tracker Pro' indicating these are Pro-only features. ❌ CORE PROBLEM: The fundamental issue is not the numeric input fix (which may be working correctly) but rather that the demo user was never actually upgraded to Pro plan as claimed in the review request. ⚠️ CRITICAL BLOCKER: Cannot test the rebuilt Action Tracker Goals and Log tabs numeric inputs because the user lacks Pro access. The review request states 'I've upgraded the demo user to PRO plan' but this upgrade was not successfully applied. 🔧 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Main agent must actually upgrade demo@demo.com to Pro plan in the backend/database before any Action Tracker testing can be performed. The numeric input rebuild cannot be verified until Pro access is granted."

CRITICAL ISSUE: Pro AI Coach button exists and is not disabled, but clicking it does not open the modal. The modal element never appears in the DOM. This prevents testing of AI analysis content, loan type badge display in modal, and modal controls. INVESTIGATION NEEDED: The modal opening mechanism appears to be broken - likely a JavaScript event handler issue, state management problem, or missing modal trigger.

FastAPI matches routes in definition order, so the generic route matches first and expects 'calculation_data' and 'property_data' keys instead of 'inputs' and 'results'. Generic route only supports 'investor' tool, not 'affordability' tool, returning 'Tool not supported' error. 🔧 REQUIRED FIX: Move @api_router.post('/reports/affordability/pdf') route definition BEFORE @api_router.post('/reports/{tool}/pdf') in server.py to allow the specific affordability route to be matched first. This is a simple route ordering fix that will immediately enable the fully-implemented affordability PDF functionality.

        comment: "✅ MODAL TRANSPARENCY FIXED: Resolved critical UI bug where 'Add Entry' modal in P&L Tracker was transparent and hard to see. ✅ ROOT CAUSE: Dialog component was using undefined CSS variables (bg-background, ring-offset-background, accent, muted-foreground) that weren't defined in Tailwind config. ✅ SOLUTION: Updated dialog.jsx to use explicit Tailwind classes: replaced 'bg-background' with 'bg-white border-gray-200', 'ring-offset-background' with 'ring-offset-white', 'bg-accent' with 'bg-gray-100', 'text-muted-foreground' with 'text-gray-600'. ✅ VERIFIED FIX: Screenshot confirms modal now displays with solid white background, clear text contrast, proper dark overlay, and all form elements (Income/Expense tabs, Date, Amount, Category dropdown, Note field, Repeat monthly checkbox, Cancel/Add Entry buttons) are easily readable and functional. Modal styling is now professional and user-friendly."

Button is not disabled (disabled: false), has proper styling classes, but clicking does not trigger modal display. Modal element with class '.fixed.inset-0.bg-black.bg-opacity-50' never appears. ❌ UNABLE TO TEST AI ANALYSIS: Cannot verify AI analysis content, loan type badge display in modal, or modal controls due to modal not opening. 🎯 CONCLUSION: Plan gating and basic calculator functionality working perfectly, but the core AI Coach modal functionality is broken. The modal opening mechanism needs investigation - likely a JavaScript event handler or state management issue preventing the modal from displaying when Pro button is clicked."

The debug logs confirm that both timeline table and visual timeline sections contain substantial HTML content and are being properly integrated into the PDF template. RECOMMENDATION: The backend debug logging has been successfully implemented and shows that timeline data generation is working correctly. The whitespace issue may be related to CSS layout or WeasyPrint PDF rendering rather than missing timeline content."

    message: "🎉 CLOSING DATE CALCULATOR PDF VISUAL TIMELINE GAP FIX VERIFICATION COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY - ALL REQUIREMENTS VERIFIED: Comprehensive testing confirms that the visual timeline gap issue has been completely resolved. ✅ ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED: The gap occurred when all timeline milestones were past-due, causing the backend to correctly filter them out and generate an empty Visual Timeline Overview section. ✅ FIX VERIFICATION: Backend function prepare_closing_date_report_data() correctly implements conditional rendering - Visual Timeline section only appears when there are active (non-past-due) timeline items. ✅ TESTING SCENARIOS: (1) Past-due timeline: All 7 items marked as 'past-due' → Visual Timeline section correctly omitted from PDF, preventing empty gaps. (2) Active timeline: 7 items with 'today'/'upcoming' status → Visual Timeline section correctly included in PDF with full content. ✅ PDF GENERATION: Both scenarios generate valid PDFs successfully via /api/reports/closing-date/pdf endpoint. ✅ TEMPLATE INTEGRATION: closing_date_report.html template correctly uses {{visualTimelineSection}} variable for conditional rendering. ✅ LAYOUT VERIFICATION: PDF flows naturally from timeline table to explanations section without gaps when Visual Timeline is omitted. The fix ensures professional, clean PDF layout by only showing Visual Timeline Overview when there's actual timeline content to display."
