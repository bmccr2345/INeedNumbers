The AI engineer's work primarily focused on iteratively enhancing and debugging a mobile-first experience for a financial application. Initially, it involved fixing a critical Safari blank screen issue, which led to a comprehensive mobile dashboard redesign with specific UI/UX requirements. Key efforts included refactoring  usage, implementing mobile-specific components (e.g., , , various modals), and addressing numerous user-reported mobile UI and data display bugs. A significant part of the trajectory involved adding Active Deals functionality, including new fields, a card on the dashboard, and a table on the P&L tracker, alongside related backend and frontend fixes. Persistent issues with backend URL configuration, especially concerning production deployment and mobile authentication, were identified and addressed through multiple iterations, often requiring temporary debug panels and environment variable checks. The conversation concludes with the removal of debugging tools after a successful fix of the backend URL for the mobile finances tab.

The I Need Numbers application is designed to provide real estate agents with financial management tools like P&L tracking, expense management, and a Commission Cap Tracker. It includes an AI Coach for PRO users and an Action Tracker. The application features a secure backend (JWT, Argon2id, HttpOnly cookies, CSRF, MongoDB rate limits) and production-ready functionalities like PDF generation.

The previous work involved addressing critical Safari blank screen issues, which expanded into a full mobile dashboard and navigation redesign. This required:
1.  **Mobile Dashboard Redesign**: Implementing mobile-specific layouts with bottom tab navigation (Overview, Calculators, Actions, More, and later Finances).
2.  **Conditional Layout Switching**: Differentiating between mobile and desktop views.
3.  **UI Adjustments**: Refining Action Tracker tabs (only Action Tracker visible on mobile), repositioning the AI Coach banner and Financial Overview, enhancing quick action buttons (+ button for Log Activity and Log Reflection, later Add Expense, Add Deal), and removing the Coach tab from mobile navigation.
4.  **P&L Integration**: Adding Total Income, Total Expense, and Budget Utilization cards to the mobile overview, and a Finances tab linking to the P&L Tracker.
5.  **Active Deals Feature**: Implementing Contract Signed, Due Diligence Start, and Due Diligence Over date fields for deals. A new Active Deals card (desktop dashboard, mobile overview) and table (P&L Tracker) displaying deals that haven't closed, with days remaining in due diligence. Deals should be editable and deletable.
6.  **Onboarding Wizard Behavior**: The onboarding wizard should only show on initial login and disappear when minimized (mobile) or stay minimized (desktop), with an option to reopen it via the '+' button.
7.  **Bug Fixes**: Addressing authentication failures, data not loading in production (due to environment variable mismatches), UI crowding on mobile, calculator menu navigation issues, pull-to-refresh logout, and nav bar drifting. Removing various debugging tools.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary, the AI engineer was addressing a critical production issue where mobile authentication was failing, and cards on the Overview page were showing zero data, particularly on the Finances tab. This was diagnosed as a  mismatch in the  file.

The engineer implemented the following:
1.  **Backend URL Correction**: The  file was updated to set , ensuring the frontend correctly points to the production backend. This was a direct fix based on troubleshooting agent's diagnosis and user's explicit instruction (lets do option 2 after being presented with fixing .env).
2.  **Debug Panel Removal**: As per user request (remove the debug), the  component was removed, and its associated imports/renderings from  and  were cleaned up.

The last confirmation from the user was that worked! regarding the backend URL fix and the debug panel removal. The system then restarted the frontend.
