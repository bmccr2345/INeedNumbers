The trajectory outlines an AI engineer's comprehensive efforts to stabilize and enhance the I Need Numbers application. The work was highly iterative, frequently addressing recurring infrastructure issues like WeasyPrint dependencies, which impacted login and PDF generation. Initial phases focused on production readiness, including Admin Console data integrity, 2FA implementation, and UI/UX refinements. Key challenges revolved around establishing a stable PDF generation pipeline (transitioning from WeasyPrint to Playwright due to environment constraints), resolving complex templating issues (Jinja2 vs. Mustache), and ensuring persistent login functionality amidst code changes and environment restarts. Each feature, from dashboard navigation redesign to AI coach output formatting and branding integration into PDFs, involved multiple debugging cycles. The trajectory concludes with the immediate task of resolving a saved error message on the Action Tracker, highlighting the continuous nature of development in a complex codebase.

The I Need Numbers application provides real estate agents with financial tools, including an Agent P&L Tracker, Recurring Expenses & Inline Editing, and a Commission Cap Tracker. A key feature is the Fairy AI Coach, exclusive to PRO users, which offers personalized insights, action plans, risk assessments, and P&L trend analysis, with outputs converted from raw JSON to human-readable format. Action Tracker functionality was enhanced with improved inputs and a Goals tab. The application prioritizes Backend Security Hardening (Argon2id, HttpOnly/Secure cookies, CSRF, MongoDB rate limits, upload validation) and Production Readiness (secure defaults, PDF branding, structured logging, comprehensive tests).

Work completed so far includes fixing admin login, implementing 2FA for admins, making Admin Console user management and billing production-ready by integrating real data, humanizing AI Coach JSON output, correctly gating features for Free Calculator users, integrating the Action Tracker's Completed column, and developing a Pro Onboarding Wizard. A major dashboard UI and navigation redesign was implemented, and persistent issues with PDF branding and login stability have been addressed, primarily by migrating PDF generation to Playwright and ensuring correct templating with pre-computed data.

    -   **Importance**: Defines all API routes, handles authentication, user data, PDF generation, and core business logic.
    -   **Changes**: Implemented password reset and change endpoints, including admin-initiated resets. Added  check for health endpoint. Significantly refactored PDF generation to use Playwright for maintaining HTML/CSS design, explicitly setting browser path. Reverted  to use a Mustache-style parser for PDF templates and pre-compute branding colors. Removed redundant  statements.
-   ****: AI Coach API logic.
    -   **Importance**: Manages the generation and formatting of AI coaching insights.
    -   **Changes**: Added specific context handling for  to ensure AI outputs are formatted into human-readable text instead of raw JSON.
-   ****: Security middleware and utilities.
    -   **Importance**: Enforces security policies, including CSRF protection.
    -   **Changes**: Modified  to include password reset and all PDF generation routes () using a  check for flexible exemption.
-   ****: Seller Net Sheet PDF template.
    -   **Importance**: Defines the visual layout and content for the Seller Net Sheet PDF, including agent branding.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to incorporate dynamic branding elements (primary color, logo) passed as simple Mustache-style variables (e.g., ) after moving complex Jinja2 conditional logic for branding and color calculation to the Python backend to resolve template parsing errors.
-   ****: Main dashboard component.
    -   **Importance**: Orchestrates the dashboard UI and navigation.
    -   **Changes**: Underwent a major refactor to implement a new collapsible, categorized sidebar navigation structure for both desktop and mobile, replacing the previous flat tab system.
-   ****: PRO user onboarding wizard component.
    -   **Importance**: Guides new PRO users through initial setup and feature discovery.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was tasked with resolving a user-reported issue on the **Action Tracker** page. The user explicitly stated, For the ACtion tracker I get a saved error message here, and provided screenshots detailing the error.

Prior to this specific issue, the engineer successfully completed two tasks:
1.  **AI Fairy Coach Minimization**: The Fairy AI coach banner on the Dashboard Overview page was configured to be minimized by default. This was achieved by modifying , specifically changing the initial state of the  variable from  to .
2.  **AI Coach Functionality Verification**: The functionality of the AI Coach was double-checked and confirmed to be working correctly. The frontend component  was verified to be using the appropriate backend endpoint () via . Login was also verified to be working correctly.

Therefore, the current active task is to investigate the saved error message occurring on the Action Tracker and implement a fix to ensure its proper functionality.
